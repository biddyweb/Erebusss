Erebus is built using Qt ( http://qt-project.org/ ), available for Windows, Linux and OS X. Windows and Linux use SFML 2 ( http://www.sfml-dev.org/ ) for the audio. The Linux version can also be built more easily from the command line. Qt version 4.7.3 or higher is required.

Linux
=====

To compile from the command line, you need to install Qt 4 and SFML 2. On Ubuntu and Debian, you can install the required Qt libraries with:

sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev

And SFML can be installed as follows - this needs version 2, which isn't currently available in Ubuntu, hence you need to add the PPA as follows:

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:sonkun/sfml-stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

(See http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=11338.0 )

To compile, open a terminal window, cd to the Erebus directory (the one containing erebus.pro). You can then compile with:

qmake erebus.pro
make

This should then produce the executable file erebus. To run, type:

./erebus

You can also install using:

sudo make install

This means you can launch erebus from the application menu.

The Linux version has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin 64-bit. This also works for the Open Pandora.

Note that the current versions of Debian (6.0 "squeeze" or earlier) only seem to have version 4.6.3 of libqt4-dev, where as Erebus requires 4.7.3 or later. You need to download from the testing or unstable repositories. This should be fixed in version 7.0 "wheezy".

Windows
=======

Use the full Qt SDK with Qt Creator to compile for Windows. This has been tested on Windows 7 and Windows 8. This should also work for Linux.

You also need SFML 2, which should be installed as follows:

* Download the version that matches bit-ness and compiler being used in Qt (I use 32-bit, VS 2008).
* Copy the Audio.hpp, Config.hpp and System.hpp files, and the Audio/ and System/ folders, from include/SFML/ to a SFML/ folder in the erebus/ folder (or copy the whole SFML include folder if you prefer; or alternatively, add the SFML include/ path to the .pro file)
* Copy the sfml-audio.lib and sfml-system.lib files, and the "-d.lib" versions of those files, to the erebus/ folder (or add the SFML/ lib path the .pro file).
* Copy the DLLs libsndfile-1.dll, openal32.dll, sfml-audio-2.dll, sfml-audio-d-2.dll, sfml-system-2.dll and sfml-system-d-2.dll to the erebus/ folder.

Symbian
=======

Use Nokia Qt SDK with Qt Creator to compile for Symbian ( http://www.developer.nokia.com/Develop/Qt/Tools/ ). Note that for Symbian, lower resolution graphics are used for some of the images - these are supplied in gfx_lores/ and should be copied to overwrite the corresponding files in the gfx/ folder. This is to help on low memory older Symbian phones (e.g., Nokia 5800), and the higher resolutions are less important on smartphone devices.

Android
=======

Use necessitas to compile for Android ( http://necessitas.kde.org/ ). This has been tested with Necessitas alpha 4 (also referred to as "beta 1"), compiled on Windows 8. You need to compile against Android API target of at least 10 (due to use of Open SLES for sound).

Other platforms
===============

It should be possible to compile Erebus on any other platform that Qt supports, though this is untested. SFML 2.0 is also required for Audio, though you can configure to use Phonon (part of Qt) instead by adding:
        CONFIG += USING_PHONON
to the start of the erebus.pro file.

History
=======

Note, this history is only for changes related to the source code. See the Erebus readme or homepage for a full history.

0.6 - Add "make install" support for Linux. Also ported to Pandora.
0.2 - Switched to using Necessitas alpha 4 for Android.
0.1 - First release.

Save games
==========

Save games are stored as xml files in a savegames folder, stored in the application data folder:

* For Windows, in %LOCALAPPDATA%\erebus .
* For Linux, it should be in $HOME/.local/share/data/erebus

General
=======

The source code is released under the GPL v3 or later.
