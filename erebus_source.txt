Erebus is built using Nokia Qt Creator ( http://qt.nokia.com/products/qt-sdk ), available for Windows, Linux and OS X. The Linux version can also be built more easily from the command line.

Linux
=====

To compile from the command line, you need to install Qt 4 and Phonon. On Ubuntu and Debian, you can install the required libraries with:

sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev
sudo apt-get install phonon
sudo apt-get install libphonon-dev 

To compile, open a terminal window, cd to the Erebus directory (the one containing erebus.pro). You can then compile with:

qmake erebus.pro
make

This should then produce the executable file erebus. To run, type:

./erebus

The Linux version has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin 32-bit.

Windows
=======

Use the full Qt SDK with Qt Creator to compile for Windows ( http://qt.nokia.com/products/qt-sdk ). This has been tested on Windows 7. This should also work for Linux.

Symbian
=======

Use Qt SDK with Qt Creator to compile for Symbian ( http://qt.nokia.com/products/qt-sdk ). Note that for Symbian, lower resolution graphics are used for some of the images - these are supplied in gfx_lores/ and should be copied to overwrite the corresponding files in the gfx/ folder. This is to help on low memory older Symbian phones (e.g., Nokia 5800), and the higher resolutions are less important on smartphone devices.

Android
=======

Use necessitas to compile for Android ( http://necessitas.kde.org/ ). This has been tested with Necessitas alpha 4 (also referred to as "beta 1"), compiled on Windows 7. You need to compile against Android API target of at least 10 (due to use of Open SLES for sound).

Other platforms
===============

It should be possible to compile Erebus on any other platform that Qt supports, though this is untested. See http://qt.nokia.com/products/qt-sdk .

History
=======

0.2 - Switched to using Necessitas alpha 4 for Android.
0.1 - First release.

General
=======

The source code is released under the GPL v3 or later.
