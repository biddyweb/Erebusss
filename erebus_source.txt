Erebus is built using Qt ( http://qt-project.org/ ), available for Windows, Linux and OS X. Windows and Linux use SFML 2 ( http://www.sfml-dev.org/ ) for the audio. The Linux version can also be built more easily from the command line. Qt version 4.8.5 or higher is required.

Linux
=====

To compile from the command line, you need to install Qt 4 and SFML 2. On Ubuntu and Debian, you can install the required libraries with:

sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

If you get an error when trying to install libsfml-dev, try the following commands:

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:sonkun/sfml-stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

(See http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=11338.0 )

To compile, open a terminal window, cd to the Erebus directory (the one containing erebus.pro). You can then compile with:

qmake erebus.pro
make

This should then produce the executable file erebus. To run, type:

./erebus

You can also install using:

sudo make install

This means you can launch erebus from the application menu.

The Linux version has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit. This also works for the Open Pandora.

Note that the current versions of Debian (6.0 "squeeze" or earlier) only seem to have version 4.6.3 of libqt4-dev, where as Erebus requires 4.8.5 or later. You need to download from the testing or unstable repositories. This should be fixed in version 7.0 "wheezy".

Windows
=======

Use the full Qt SDK with Qt Creator to compile for Windows. This has been tested on Windows 7 and Windows 8. This should also work for Linux. The Windows version is compiled with Qt 4.8.5.

You also need SFML 2, which should be installed as follows:

* Download the version that matches bit-ness and compiler being used in Qt (I use 32-bit, VS 2008).
* Copy the Audio.hpp, Config.hpp and System.hpp files, and the Audio/ and System/ folders, from include/SFML/ to a SFML/ folder in the erebus/ folder (or copy the whole SFML include folder if you prefer; or alternatively, add the SFML include/ path to the .pro file)
* Copy the sfml-audio.lib and sfml-system.lib files, and the "-d.lib" versions of those files, to the erebus/ folder (or add the SFML/ lib path the .pro file).
* Copy the DLLs libsndfile-1.dll, openal32.dll, sfml-audio-2.dll, sfml-audio-d-2.dll, sfml-system-2.dll and sfml-system-d-2.dll to the erebus/ folder.

Android
=======

The Android version is compiled using Qt 5.3.1.

Symbian
=======

Versions 0.10 and earlier supported Symbian, but this has now been dropped for 0.11 onwards. Possibly the latest source may still compile, though this is untested.

Other platforms
===============

It should be possible to compile Erebus on any other platform that Qt supports, though this is untested. SFML 2.0 is also required for audio.

History
=======

Note, this history is only for changes related to the source code. See the Erebus readme or homepage for a full history.

0.15 - Android version now compiled using Qt 5.3.1 rather than Necessitas.
0.11 - Symbian port dropped. Switched from using Phonon to SFML for audio. Dependency on QtWebKit removed. Windows version now compiled with Qt 4.8.5.
0.6 - Added "make install" support for Linux. Also ported to Pandora.
0.2 - Switched to using Necessitas alpha 4 for Android.
0.1 - First release.

Save games
==========

Save games are stored as xml files in a savegames folder, stored in the application data folder:

* For Windows, in %LOCALAPPDATA%\erebus .
* For Linux, it should be in $HOME/.local/share/data/erebus

General
=======

The source code is released under the GPL v3 or later.
