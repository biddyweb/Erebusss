<quest name="The Necromancer">

<info>After completing your previous quest, you retire with your riches to take a much needed break. You can now afford luxuries that you never had before - a large house, exquisite foods, fine clothes. A year passes by peacefully.

You should have noticed the warning signs sooner, but they seemed isolated incidents at first. Late on one summer evening whilst walking along a country road, you saw what looked like a grinning skeleton behind some trees, but before you could investigate closer, whatever it was had vanished, and you passed it off as a trick of the light.

...

News has been received from other villages of a spreading evil across the land - the dead are rising from their graves, say the reports, and some villages have completely fallen under the control of undead legions.

Many suspect the work of a necromancer to be the cause, and fear that a great army of undead will soon sweep across the land.

You are eager to do what you can to help. You head east towards the village of Axbury. There you should seek out a person named Borin, who is known for being knowledgable in these matters.

This worn and battered old scarecrow watches over the fields. As you examine it, for a moment you are sure that there is some movement - a slight turn of the head, a movement of its makeshift eyes, and you have a feeling of being watched. It must be your eyes playing tricks on you.

<opening_initial>Hello. A great evil plagues this land. You look like someone who could help us?

But you could help me by finding one of my Scrying Orbs - I put one in a dungeon to the south for safe keeping. I can then use it to identify the source of this evil.
</talk>
<talk question="I have found the Scrying Orb for you" objective="true">
Ah, thank you. Now let's see - it's been a while since I've used this old orb. Yes - ah, I see it now. There is indeed great evil, the dead walk across the land.

A necromancer is certainly behind this evil, but unfortuntely I cannot see his location. But I do see a great concentration of power in the village of Dunbridge, to the east - or what remains of it. Now all I see is smouldering buildings and rotten corpses, slain by a skeleton army.

They are led by a Skeleton Lord, who needs to be slain, but it is protected by powerful magic. Hmm, I'm afraid that's the extent of my vision. For more help, I suggest you check out Ravencrag Fort, also to the east.
