<quest>

<info>After completing your previous quest, you retire with your riches to take a much needed break. You can now afford luxuries that you never had before - a large house, exquisite foods, fine clothes. A year passes by peacefully.

You should have noticed the warning signs sooner, but they seemed isolated incidents at first. Late on one summer evening whilst walking along a country road, you saw what looked like a grinning skeleton behind some trees, but before you could investigate closer, whatever it was had vanished, and you passed it off as a trick of the light.

...

News has been received from other villages of a spreading evil across the land - the dead are rising from their graves, say the reports, and some villages have completely fallen under the control of undead legions.

Many suspect the work of a necromancer to be the cause, and fear that a great army of undead will soon sweep across the land.

You are eager to do what you can to help.
