</p>

<p><b>Features:</b><ul>
<li>Classic point-n-click style RPG, with dungeons to explore, enemies to fight, NPCs to talk to, sub-quests to complete, scenery to interact with, weapons, treasure and other items to find.</li>
<li>Also supports Rogue-like keyboard controls.</li>
<li>Multiple quests (currently only two, more will be added as development progresses!)</li>
<li>Choice of starting characters (currently Barbarian, Elf, Halfling, Ranger, Warrior).</li>
<li>Start straight into the action - none of this "For your first quest, please find your next door neighbour's pet cat".</li>
<li>Vector-based world rather than tile-based - so items/scenery can be placed in any position, or aligned in any direction.</li>
<li>2D animated graphics, with zoom in/out, and lighting effects.</li>
<li>Completely free and Open Source - no ads, unlike many free Android apps.</li>
<li>User interface optimised to work with mouse, keyboard and/or touchscreen.</li>
<li>Cross-platform - available for Windows, Linux, Nokia Symbian and Android devices.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a name="requirements"><b>Requirements</b></p>

<p>Erebus should work on any Windows or Linux PC. Erebus is tested on
Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit), Windows 8 Pro and Ubuntu Linux 12.04 32 bit; and with
Intel GMA 3100, Intel HD 4000 and NVIDIA GTX 675M graphics. Erebus should work
fine with Windows touchscreens, including pure tablets, though this is untested.
Note that for Windows 8, Erebus only runs on Intel or AMD x86 devices, and not
Windows RT (ARM) (e.g., it should work fine on the Surface Pro, but the cheaper
Surface RT is not supported).</p>

<p>For Nokia Symbian smartphones, this requires S60 5th edition (Symbian^1) or
later - the Nokia Ovi Store should let you know if it's compatible with your phone.
Erebus has been tested on the Nokia 5800. Older smartphones with only 128MB RAM
(e.g., Nokia 5800) may have trouble if too many other applications are running. Also
try disabling Lighting Effects (from Options on main menu) if you are having trouble.</p>

<p>For Android, this requires Android 2.3.3 or higher, and has been tested with the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.1.2. A resolution of at least 800x480 is
recommended. Older phones with 256MB RAM or less may have trouble running Erebus.
This also requires installing the app
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.necessitas.ministro">Ministro</a>,
which you should be prompted to do when you first run Erebus (if it's not already
installed). Ministro manages the required Qt libraries on Android. These will be
downloaded if required when you first run Erebus. If you get an error message such
as "Ministro can not satisfy your application dependencies", please ensure you
have enough storage space (the libraries can take up to around 25MB).</p>

<p>If the performance of the game seems too slow, then try disabling "Lighting
Effects" (quit the game, then from the main menu, go to Options).</p>

<p>If the game fails to run, or has problems, please try the following:<ul>
  <li>For Windows, make sure you have installed the required libraries/DLLs (see
  Windows download, above).</li>
  <li>On Linux, try running from the command line (from Terminal window, type
  erebus) to see if that gives any informative error message.</li>
  <li>Ensure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card.</li>
  <li>On Android, on rare occasions Ministro may fail to download the required
  libraries due to network or server problems - please try again later to see if
  the problem still persists.</li>
  <li>Please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> to report any problems.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a name="mainmenu"><b>Main menu</b></p>

<p>The main menu has options to start the game or load a previously saved game,
or set some options. The available options are:<ul>
<li><b>Sound</b> - Whether sound/music is enabled.</li>
<li><b>Lighting Effects</b> - If enabled, a lighting effect surrounds your player. If you
get poor performance, try disabling this option.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>You can also select "Offline help" to open up these instructions, or "Online
help" to launch this website in your browser ("Online help" is better as it
allows you to play the game while the instructions are open in the browser, as
well as meaning you get the latest version of the webpage, but "Offline help" is
useful if you are without an Internet connection).</p>

<p>When starting the game, you also have various choices:<ul>
<li><b>Character</b> - Choice of Barbarian, Elf, Halfling, Ranger or Warrior. This is who you will play as, and affects your starting statistics, and the items you start with. Some characters may be easier to play with than others!</li>
<li><b>Difficulty</b> - Affects things like how easy or hard it will be to defeat enemies in combat, avoid traps, and so on.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a name="quickstart"><b>Quickstart</b></p>

<p>Click "Start game", then "Start". After the game loads, you'll be shown details
of your first quest: to kill all the goblins in the dungeon.</p>

<p>To move your character, click where you want to move to (either with the mouse,
or touch for touchscreens). You can scroll the view around by clicking/touching
and dragging (also on PCs, you can scroll by moving the mouse to the edge of the
screen).</p>

<p>Move your character to the right, to the crossroads, and you will soon be
attacked by a goblin! To fight, click/touch on the goblin.</p>

<p>Towards the top left will be displayed your name, and a green bar indicating
your health. When you are attacking an enemy, next to this will be displayed the
name of the enemy, and a red bar indicating its health.</p>

<p>Hopefully you will be able to defeat the goblin, which will then leave
behind some gold to pick up. Enemies may be carrying gold and/or items, which
they leave behind when they die. To pick up gold or an item, simply click/touch
to move over the item, then click/touch on the item to pick it up.</p>

<p>Now explore the rest of the dungeon, and kill all remaining goblins! If you
encounter doors, click/touch on them to open the door. You will be told when
you have completed the quest. When this is so, return to where you started, and
exit through the door that was to the left. You can do this by click/touching to
move to the door, then click/touch to exit.</p>

<p>This should be enough information to get you started, but it is recommened
to read the rest of the instructions here!</p>

<p><a name="controls"><b>Controls</b></p>

<p>As explained in "Quickstart", you can move your character around by
click/touching where you want to move to. You can also click/touch and drag to
move the view around. On PCs you can also scroll by moving the mouse to the edge
of the screen. You can always centre on the player by clicking the "O" button
at the bottom right.</p>

<p>You can zoom in and out by using the "-" and "+" buttons at the bottom. You
can also use the "zoom" gesture on multitouch touchpads or multitouch
touchscreens.</p>

<p>There are various other controls:<ul>
<li><b>Attack an enemy</b> - Click on the enemy. If you have a ranged weapon,
you will be able to shoot enemies from a distance.</li>
<li><b>Talking to an NPC</b> - For friendly NPCs, you can click on them to talk
to them. Some NPCs will be traders or shopkeepers, and talking to them will
allow you to buy and sell items.</li>
<li><b>Opening a door</b> - Walk up near to the door, then click on the door.
Some doors will "open" simply by disappearing and letting you walk through the
door. Other doors are "exits", and clicking on them will take you to a different
location. Some doors may be locked, and can only be opened if you have the correct
key. To leave the dungeon, click on the exit that was near where you started.
You can leave the dungeon at any time, including before completing the quest -
if the quest isn't yet completed, you will be allowed to rest, healing your
wounds, as well as being able to spend money in shops, before returning to the
dungeon to complete your quest.</li>
<li><b>Interacting with scenery / opening containers</b> - You can try
interacting with any scenery by walking up to it and clicking on it. For example,
clicking on a treasure chest will reveal any times inside it. Other kinds of
scenery may show you a set of options when you click on them.</li>
<li><b>Picking up items</b> - Click on the items when you are standing near to
them. Note that at the moment you don't get a choice if there is more than one
- so click repeatedly to pick them all up, then drop any that you don't want
(see below).</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Erebus can also be controlled via a keyboard:<ul>
<li><b>Move</b> with the arrow keys, or W/A/S/D (use combinations to move
diagonally), or the numeric keypad.</li>
<li><b>Action</b> - Press space or return/enter for a generic action, which will be:
attack or talk to an NPC in front of you (or otherwise attack the nearest enemy
if you are armed with a ranged weapon); open a door in front of you; interact
with scenery (or open a container) in front of you, or picking up items at your
feet.</li>
<li><b>Force pick up</b> - You can also pick up items at your feet by pressing
"U" (normally pressing space/enter will work, but not if there's also something
in front to interact with).</li>
</ul></p>

<p>There are further controls and information that can be accessed from the
buttons on the left hand side (or via a keyboard shortcut):</p>

<p><a name="stats"><b>Stats (F1)</b></p>

<p>This shows your character's current statistics, which indicate how good you
are at various activities, as well as your current health, and experience:<ul>
<li><b>Fighting Prowess (FP)</b> - How skilled your character is in hand-to-hand
combat.</li>
<li><b>Bow Skill (BS)</b> - How skilled your character is at firing bows.</li>
<li><b>Strength (S)</b> - How strong your character is. Stronger characters are
able to inflict stronger blows on their enemies. They can also carry more
items.</li>
<li><b>Attacks (A)</b> - Currently unused.</li>
<li><b>Mind (M)</b> - Currently unused.</li>
<li><b>Dexterity (D)</b> - How good your character is at avoiding traps, and
avoiding being hit by arrows.</li>
<li><b>Bravery (B)</b> - Some enemies (such as the undead) cause <i>terror</i>.
This may cause you to be temporarily paralysed from fear when you encounter
them. A higher bravery score reduces the chance of this happening.</li>
<li><b>Speed (Sp)</b> - How fast your character moves.</li>
<li><b>Health (H)</b> - Your current health and "maximum" health. Your health can
never exceed the maximum value (though the maximum value will increase as your
character becomes more experienced). If your health reaches 0, you are dead.</li>
<li><b>Level</b> - Your character's experience level. This will increase every so
often when you receive enough XP (see below). Every time it increases, some of
your character's stats will increase.</li>
<li><b>XP</b> - Your current XP, and how many are needed to progress to the next
Level. You receive XP by various actions, such as killing enemies, unlocking
doors, completing sub-quests.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a name="items"><b>Items (F2)</b></p>

<p>This window displays the items that you are carrying. You can filter the list
by selecting the options along the top (e.g., to only display weapons, click
"Wpns"). The window also displays how much gold you have, and the current
weight in the format "current weight / maximum weight". If the current weight
exceeds the maximum weight you can carry, you must drop some items before you
can move.</p>

<p>To do more with a particular item, select the item by clicking it. You can
then:<ul>
<li>Drop the item, by clicking "Drop Item" at the bottom.</li>
<li>Read more information on the item, by clicking "Info" at the bottom.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>There are also special types of items: weapons, armour and shields.</p>

<p>Weapons are used in combat. Your current weapon, if any, is indicated with
"[Current Weapon]". To use a different weapon, select it then click "Arm
Weapon". You can also disarm the current weapon by selecting it and clicking
"Disarm Weapon". If you have no weapon armed you will fight with your fists,
though this is not recommended. Different weapons have different amounts of
damage, which you can see by selecting the "Info" option. Damage is given in a
format of rolling dice, as: "X"D"Y" + "Z", where "X" is the number of dice
thrown, "Y" is the type of dice ("Y" equal to 10 means a D10, i.e., a 10 sided
die with numbers 1 to 10), "Z" is the number added to the value. So "2D10 + 1"
means roll two D10s, add the results, and add 1. "3D6 - 1" means roll three
D6s, add the results, and subtract 1.</p>

<p>Some weapons are "ranged" (e.g., bows) which means you can use them from a
distance. They also need ammunition (e.g., arrows are needed for bows) which are
stored as a separate item.</p>

<p>Some weapons have a minimum strength (see "Info") - if your strength is not
high enough, you will be unable to fight with this weapon!</p>

<p>Armour is worn to protect you in combat, reducing the damage you take. Similar
to with weapons, the currently worn armour is indicated with "[Current Armour]",
and you can change into new armour by selecting it, and clicking "Wear Armour"
(or "Take Off Armour" to take it off).</p>

<p>Some armour types have a minimum strength (see "Info") - if your strength is
not high enough, you will be unable to move with this armour!</p>

<p>Shields may also be used, but not if you are using a two-handed weapon. To
use a shield, select the shield and click "Arm Shield" (or "Disarm Shield" to
stop using it). A shield will provide you with extra protection in combat.</p>

<p>Some other kinds of items may allow additional options - e.g., potions
allowing you the option to drink them.</p>

<p>This offers the following options:<ul>
<li><b>Quit game</b> - Quits the current game. Make sure you save the game
first if you don't want to lose it!</li>
<li><b>Save game</b> - Saves the current game under a filename of your choosing
(or overwrite an existing one). A default filename is provided consisting of the
current date and time. As with resting, you cannot save the game if enemies are
nearby. Note that the game will be automatically saved when you move from one
location to another, under "autosave.xml" (except on Symbian).</li>
<li><b>Back to game</b> - Don't do anything, and return to the game.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a name="leavingthedungeon"><b>Leaving the dungeon</b></p>

<p>As explained above, you can leave the dungeon at any time by clicking on the
exit near where you started. This will heal your wounds (as with resting). You
can also visit various shops to buy items with your gold, and sell any items you
found that you don't want. Note that the sale price of items will always be less
than the purchase price!</p>

<p>If you haven't completed your quest yet, you can click "Continue your Quest"
to return to the dungeon to complete your quest. If you had completed the quest,
then you can click "Start next Quest" to start the next quest.</p>

<p>If you are on the last quest, and have completed it, then leaving the dungeon
means you have completed the game! Note that currently Erebus is a work in
progress, and more quests will be added in future versions. If you have a save
game file, this should be compatible with future versions (note that changes to
the quest you are currently playing will not take effect on any existing save
game files, to avoid risk of incompatibilities, but you should be able to move
onto any new quests that have been added).</p>

<p><a name="enemies"><b>Enemies</b></p>

<p>There are many dangerous enemies you may meet during your adventures:</p>

<p><b>Goblins.</b> These are small, foul creatures. Whilst one of the weaker
races of evil, they are still able to overpower less experienced adventurers,
and can be deadly in numbers. Whilst many goblins form their own tribes,
others are found enslaved by larger creatures such as Orcs.</p>

<p><b>Orcs.</b> These are the most common enemy to civilised societies. Large
and brutish, they are physically stronger than many humans. They mostly dwell
underground in caves and dungeons, but can be found in the wilderness. They
typically live and travel in packs. They usually keep away from human
settlements, instead only attacking travellers and adventurers, but they are
most dangerous when well trained and organised into armies.</p>

<p><b>Wyverns.</b> Winged reptiles. These fast flying animals are often hostile.</p>

<p><b>Zombies.</b> These unnatural beings are rotting corpses of the recently
deceased, animated back to life by magical means. These undead creatures move
slowly, but are strong opponents.</p>

<p><b>Shadows.</b> These undead beings are ghostly creatures, trapped on this
earthly plane. These evil creatures were once people. Now, they can be harmed
only by magical weapons.</p>

<p><b>Giant Spiders.</b> Some species of spider can grow to a size larger than
a human. They may be found underground, or in some parts of the wilderness.</p>

<p><b>Minotaurs.</b> The head of bull with the body of a human, these creatures
are presumably created through magical means or perhaps other experimentation.</p>

<p><a name="additionalinfo"><b>Additional info</b></p>

<p>On non-mobile platforms, Erebus can be run in windowed mode by running from the command line
with the argument "-windowed". E.g., on Windows, run with:

<pre>erebus.exe -windowed</pre></p>

<p>Please contact me at <b>mark dot harman at ntlworld dot com</b> .</p>

<p>If you are reporting a bug, if possible please send me:<ul>
  <li>Any reported error messages.</li>
	<li>The "log.txt" file. This can be found:<ul>
    <li>For Windows, in %LOCALAPPDATA%\erebus .</li>
    <!--<li>
      For Linux, in $HOME/.config/gigalomania (in Ubuntu, go to menu Places->Home Folder,
      then make sure View->Show Hidden Files is selected, then open the folder .config).
    </li>-->
    <!--<li>
      For Symbian it's located in the folder private/200353ef on the drive that you installed the
      game on.--><!--The folder needs changing, if we change the UID of the game!--> <!--Seeing this folder
      is a bit tricky, as it's hidden when viewing on the phone. You can access by connecting your
      phone to a PC and selecting "mass storage" to view the drives (though this may only be possible
      if you've installed to an external SD card).
    </li>-->
    <!--<li>
      For Android, it's located in the folder net.sourceforge.gigalomania/. You can view with a file

      phone before connecting to your PC.
    </li>-->
  </ul>
  The log file is overwritten each time you run the game, so you'll have to take a copy straight
  away - although note that the last-but-one game log will be available under "log_old.txt"; in
  the case of assertion failures, it will also be copied to "log_assertion_failure.txt".</li>
  <li>If under Linux and no log.txt file is generated, try running erebus from a Terminal

  <li>A description of what happened, and what steps you took that resulted in the bug.</li>
  <li>Does the bug happen every time?</li>
  <li>Any details of your system may also be helpful, e.g.: operating system and version, CPU, graphics
  card, Direct X version if relevant, make/model of smartphone/tablet if relevant.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><a name="helpwanted"><b>Help wanted!</b></p>

<p>If you would like to contribute to Erebus, there are various ways you can help:<ul>
<li><b>Graphics artists</b> - More graphics (scenery, NPCs and so on) would be useful to have. Please contact me if you want info on the expected graphics/animation formats, or what sort of images would be useful.</li>
<li><b>Musicians</b> - It would be useful to have background music for the game. More sound effects are also welcome!</li>
<li><b>Porting</b> - Feel free to port Erebus to other platforms - it should be easy to port to any OS that supports Qt. If code changes are required, if you send me the files I can integrate them into the main source (please check the Git repository on Sourceforge for the latest version to work with).</li>
<li><b>Tell people about it!</b> - If you like the game, then please feel free to tell other people about it, on your blog/Twitter/website/etc :)</li>
<li><b>Give me a nice rating :)</b> (On Nokia/Android stores, or other hosting sites...)</li>
<li><b>Videos</b> - videos of the gameplay (e.g., on YouTube) would be useful to have, partly to help raise awareness, and also to act as gameplay tutorials.</li>
</ul>
Any content for Erebus must be releaed under a Free/Open Source compatible licence (e.g., <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY 3.0</a>) for me to be able to use it.</p>
